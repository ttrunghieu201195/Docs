1.	3 methoods for reducing power consumption oi inverter > 
-> reduce operating frequency
-> reduce load capacitance
-> reduce power supply voltage
2.	2 regions in Ids-Vds current & what is the boundary
	Linear
	Saturation
	Pinch off point (boundaries)
3.	2 regions in Igs-Vgs current & what is the boundary?
-> Normal and sub threshold
-> Boundary: Vgs = Vth (slide 59)
	
4.	List up 4 methods to shorten of delay time of an inverter (Make CMOS inverter faster) > inverter slide
>	Load capacitance CL is smaller
>	Power supply voltage, Vdd is higher
>	|Vth| is smaller
>	β is geater
(Slide 77)
5.	Describe which transistor is faster nMOS,PMOS ? why ? 
>	nMOS is 3 times faster than PMOS> use larger PMOS gate.
6.	3 goals in LSI design > over view
	Functional
	Performance
	Time to market
	profitable
7.	3 way to increase the source-drain current of MOS transistor > W,L,Vth
	Increase Channel length (W)
	Increase Gate capacitance (Cox)
	Reduce Channel Length (L)
Refer (Slide 34)
8.	How to reduce the sub_threshold leakage after an MOS transistor is fabricated
	Change threshold voltage by (or?) changing Vds
9.	2 major timing parameter in synchoronous design > setup time , hold time
	Set up and hold time …..
10.	Merits of CMOS inverter
