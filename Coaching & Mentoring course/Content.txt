This is HW/FED2/Nguyen Nguyen, who will accompany with you this course on Sep 20, 2019.
Many thanks for your registration (**) for Coaching and mentoring course, to give me a chance to work with you!

I put discussion material in (*):
P:\Employee\HR\Training\2019\Coaching & Mentoring course\Sep_20

Time: 8h30 ~ 17h00 Sep 20, 2019
Venue: Lecture room 1.

Please refer material as you have time. Basically, I can teach you nothing via this course.
You may explore by yourselves via discussion. It is quite stupid simple.

During discussion, we may need to do some attached survey to identify learning style and personality trait.
Base on it, we may choose suitable learning method for mentee.
It is an advantage if you can proceed them in advance.
You also may ask your mentees (if any) to do survey for your understanding and use it as case study during discussion.
To know how to proceed it, please refer to Example sheet of each survey. You can read result in Result sheet

Basically, you should keep the result by yourself.
You also may contact me (until end of Sep 20) for advance consultant if you really need it.
